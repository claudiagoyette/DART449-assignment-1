			<h1>Student presentation</h1>
			<p> Hello, I'm Claudia Goyette. I'm a 4th year Computation Arts student at Concordia</p>
			<p> It is my last semester here (fingers crossed) and after graduation I wish to start an internship in graphic design.</p>
			<p> My interest are mostly 2d images and the relation between words and space. I pay a lot of attention to visual details.  </p>
      <p> This website contains the exercices I will realize throughtout this semester for the DART 449 class.  </p>
