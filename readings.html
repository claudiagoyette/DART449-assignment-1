		<h2>As We May Think by Vannevar Bush</h2>
	</hgroup>
	<article>
In his article, Dr. Vannevar Bush says scientists who have worked on wartime experiments will have to do something else now that the war is almost over. Scientists (biologists, physicists, etc.) who contributed to the war effort helped men to better protect themselves and to have all the necessary material tools to defend themselves.

	According to the author, scientists must now focus on making knowledge accessible to all. It wants to give access to knowledge by improving dissemination tools. He wants to see progress in the way the data is transmitted and wants to make his data as simple as possible so that everyone understands what it is. It is a very visionary article for the year of 1945, the text was intended to set the direction for research in the post-war period. Since this period was revolutionized by the invention of the atomic bomb, Bush wanted to direct attention to other possibilities for science.

	To do this, Dr. Vannevar Bush created a device in which there are several different information on different subjects. "Memex" is actually a library that groups all the data that a person has (books, movies, communications). The machine thus allows the user to navigate among his data which is condensed in a single device. "Memex" also serves as a means of linking information. This machine is, in my opinion, an older version of a computer.

			<h2>How the atom bomb helped give birth to the Internet by Johnny Ryan</h2>
		</hgroup>
		<article>
			I really like reading this article because it explained everything we have to know about the creation of the internet. The author relates using an historical point of view how the web is what is is nowadays. Using this approach is totally different and helped me understand why the internet was created and now I realized that it was for a complete different purpose that I have always believed.

		Knowing that is all started during a war period is impressive. The problem was that they needed server that would « provide reliable command and control of nuclear forces even if enemy strikes had wiped out large part of the network ». It’s a decentralized networks that could sustain multiple hits and keep working through alternative channels. This is how Baran came up with the term packet switching (method of grouping data which is transmitted over a digital network into packets) benefiting information transmission. It is fascinating that he already had in mind masse communication.

		It still amaze me how inventors in the 1960s were able to predict the use of internet nowadays. It is all because of creators like Baran, who even if at first didn’t succeed, still pushed through and allowed us to have access to information form around the globe.

				<h2>Writing the History of the Internet by Roy Rosenberg </h2>
			</hgroup>
			<article>
				This article really first explains the creation and how the internet was born, but it is also about what the major players of this time dealt with it. Rosenberg mentions a lot of important names for the history of internet wether for its creation like I mentioned previously or for it’s commercialisation. This is an aspect of it’s development I wasn’t totally aware of but find very interesting. The way the author talks about competitors and marketing strategies open our eyes on the value of this invention. Some people wants to privatise it, some other wants it to stay open to the public. With the wave of privatisation that happened in the 1980s ; private vs public school for example, it was just normal for them to turn something that was accessible to the public and make it private to own by companies and governments. It is a concept that makes sense for me, it is normal them to want more and more money. But what I don’t understand is why turning the web into a private ressource when at first it was supposed to give access to knowledge to everyone.

Because we live in a world based on capitalism ; it was only normal that this gold invention was available to everyone, of course they had to put regulation on it to make a certain kind of profit. It is just the way society works nowadays.

					<h2>The Virtual Revolution : The Great Levelling</h2>
				</hgroup>
				<article>
					I love how this documentary talks about using the internet to communicate and to express ourselves. The web allows people to connect with the rest of the world, share ideas, discuss and reflect on them with people you would never have the chance to meet otherwise. It is a way of self expression that have no limits. When it is used correctly, in blogs for example, it is a good way to manifeste our opinions to the governments about politics, human rights and a lot of other subjects for that matter.

The world wide web, invented by M. Tim Burners-Lee in 1969 with HTML and online programming language, has really evolved since. Platforms are more accessible to everyone. I think the internet is the internationalization of the knowledge. In the documentary, they talk about wikipedia and his founder. Wikipedia is a great example of how we use web to get information but also how everyone has access to those information and have some power over it. Before, everything that was published on internet was controlled by the government of independent countries, now it is impossible to do so. Sure some companies have direct power over this, but basically, the content is still created by people and for people.

Although, I’m not sure if we can talk of levelling because in our capitalist society, everyone wants more. Now, the internet is all about money. We create software to make money, we make online publicity to make money, etc. The goal is not the same as when the World Wide Web was first created but Im still very exited to see what’s next.
